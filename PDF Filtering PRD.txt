PRD: Filtered Layer Rendering for PDF Generation
Problem
PDF generation takes 20 seconds due to html2canvas rendering 10,000+ vector features across all 16 layers. Resulting maps are visually cluttered and unreadable.

Solution
Render only the specific features that matched during analysis, not entire layers. Store matched feature geometries during analysis, create temporary filtered layers during PDF generation.

Technical Requirements
1. Modify Analysis Functions (analysis.js)
All three analysis functions must return complete GeoJSON features, not just properties.

analyzeCorridorMatch(): Store matched route geometries
analyzeIntersection(): Store matched polygon geometries
analyzeProximity(): Already stores properties - add geometry

Return format:
javascript{
  type: 'Feature',
  geometry: { ... },
  properties: { ... }
}

2. Modify PDF Generation (pdf.js)
Replace "add all layers" logic with filtered layer creation.
Around line 45 in generatePDF():

Remove Object.keys(DATASETS).forEach(...) that adds all layers
Create temporary L.geoJSON layers containing only currentResults[datasetKey] features
Apply proper styling from DATASETS config
Handle Point/LineString/Polygon geometry types
Add temp layers to map for capture
Remove temp layers after capture

3. Maintain Backward Compatibility

Results display in sidebar unchanged (still shows names/properties)
PDF results section unchanged (still lists matched features)
Only map rendering changes

Success Criteria

PDF generation completes in 5-10 seconds (down from 20)
PDF map shows ONLY: basemap + drawn project + matched features
Visual clutter eliminated
Project line is clearly visible in PDF map
All existing functionality preserved

Out of Scope

Changing analysis logic or thresholds
Modifying result display format
Adding new datasets
Feature Service integration
