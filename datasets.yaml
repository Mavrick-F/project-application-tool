# ============================================
# DATASET CONFIGURATION FOR MEMPHIS MPO PROJECT APPLICATION TOOL
# ============================================
# This YAML file defines all datasets used in spatial analysis.
# Each dataset specifies its file location, geometry type, analysis method, and styling.
#
# GEOMETRY TYPES:
#   - Point: Single coordinate locations (bridges, employers, crash sites)
#   - LineString: Connected line segments (roads, routes, corridors)
#   - Polygon: Closed shapes defining areas (zones, wetlands, districts)
#
# ANALYSIS METHODS:
#   - listParallelFeatures: For lines running parallel to project (requires bufferDistance & minSharedLength)
#   - listIntersectingFeatures: For areas that overlap with project (polygons, geometric overlap)
#   - listNearbyFeatures: For features near project (requires proximityBuffer distance)
#   - countByCategory: Like listNearbyFeatures but counts features by a field (e.g., crash severity)
#   - hasNearbyFeatures: Returns yes/no if ANY feature is within buffer (for large datasets)
#   - measureProjectByCategory: Calculates total length broken down by status field
#   - measureIntersectedArea: Calculates acreage of intersected polygon features
#   - projectCoverage: Calculates percentage of project within coverage areas
#
# COLOR CODES: Use hex format (#RRGGBB) or named colors
#   Examples: '#FF0000' (red), '#228B22' (forest green), '#0066CC' (blue)
#
# OPACITY VALUES: 0.0 (transparent) to 1.0 (fully opaque)
#   Typical values: 0.3 (light), 0.6 (medium), 0.9 (strong)
#
# WEIGHT: Line thickness in pixels (1-5 typical, 10+ for emphasis)
#
